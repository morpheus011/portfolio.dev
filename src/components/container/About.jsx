            Hello! I'm Nucleus, from Kanpur, India. I am pursuing my
            Masters(M.C.A) from Kamla Nehru Institute of Science & Technology,
            in Computer Science and Engineering (2022-2024). I am a passionate
            software engineer. Currently learning and exploring more on Full
            Stack Web Development in which I am more focused toward the Frontend
            Part. My core skills are mostly based on JavaScript, which is the
            love of my programming life. I am also looking forward to
            collaborate with like minded people on projects to build some
            real-world problem solving tools. Also trying to contribute more in
            open source to serve the community by my knowledge and experience. I
            am also open to work for any Freelancing Project based on my skill
            set ðŸ˜Š.
